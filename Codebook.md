# Codebook for Assignment

There are two outputs that are produced as a result of this assignment


# Output 1: Data

The data output gives the mean and standard deviation of each variable for each observation. These observations correspond to a subject number (shown in the subject_no column) and an activity (corresponding to the activity_no code and activity_desc which describes the activity performed)


# Output 2: Summary

The summary provides the average for each of the variables in the output data above, grouped by each activity and each subject. The table shows only the combinations where observations were taken and excludes the combinations with no observations


# Notes
